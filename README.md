Helps you create a REST API from your OpenAPI specification.

This bundle supports a design-first methodology for creating an API with Symfony by providing the following tools:
* Loading the [path items](https://swagger.io/specification/#pathItemObject) and [operations](https://swagger.io/specification/#operationObject) of an OpenAPI specification as routes.
* Validating the incoming JSON request bodies to those routes.
* Exception handling.

## Installation

### Applications that use Symfony Flex
Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute:

```console
composer require nijens/openapi-bundle
```

### Applications that don't use Symfony Flex

#### Step 1: Download the Bundle

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

```console
composer require nijens/openapi-bundle
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.

#### Step 2: Enable the Bundle

Then, enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
in the `app/AppKernel.php` file of your project:

```php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new Nijens\OpenapiBundle\NijensOpenapiBundle(),
        );

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Usage
Before starting with the implementation of the bundle, you should take the time to design your API according 
to the OpenAPI specification.

The following resources can help you with designing the specification:
* [OpenAPI specification version 3](https://swagger.io/specification)
* [Swagger specification editor](https://editor.swagger.io)

### Routing and validation
This bundle provides a route loader and request validator that is able to load operations from your OpenAPI specification
```yaml
# config/routes/openapi.yaml or app/config/routes.yml

api:
    prefix: /api
    resource: ../openapi.json # or ../openapi.yaml
    type: openapi
    name_prefix: "api_"
```

When the operations of the path items have a `requestBody` property configured with the content-type 'application/json', 
the bundle validates the incoming request bodies for those routes in the specification.

#### Configuring a controller for a route
A Symfony controller for a route is configured by adding the `x-symfony-controller` property to an operation within your OpenAPI specification.
```json
{
    "paths": {
        "/pets/{uuid}": {
            "put": {
                "x-symfony-controller": "Nijens\\OpenapiBundle\\Controller\\PetController::put",
                "requestBody": {
                    "content": {
                        "application/json": {
                            "schema": {
                                "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                },
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": "Returns the stored pet."
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The value of the `x-symfony-controller` property is the same as you would normally add to a [Symfony route](https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html#creating-routes).

## Custom Error Handling

The default error response template looks like:
```json
{
    "message": "Validation of JSON request body failed.",
    "errors": [
        "The property iAmRequired is required",
        "The property iAmExtra is not defined and the definition does not allow additional properties"
    ]
}
```

If your project requires a different formatting of the response or perhaps different response codes, the default
response builder can be overridden. Following the ["How to Decorate Services" guide from Symfony](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/service_decoration.html),
you can define your own service which implements `ExceptionJsonResponseBuilderInterface` and handles the error response
building instead of `nijens_openapi.service.exception_json_response_builder`. When validation against the schema fails,
an exception will be thrown which implements `HttpExceptionInterface`. The `getErrors()` method will provide a
multi-dimensional array similar to this:
```php
array(
    array(
        'property' => 'iAmRequired',
        'pointer' => '/iAmRequired',
        'message' => 'The property iAmRequired is required',
        'constraint' => 'required',
        'context' => 1,
    ),
    array(
        'property' => '',
        'pointer' => '',
        'message' => 'The property iAmExtra is not defined and the definition does not allow additional properties',
        'constraint' => 'additionalProp',
        'context' => 1,
    ),
)
```
